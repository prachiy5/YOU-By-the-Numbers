## Overview  
This project is a creative data storytelling piece inspired by the Netflix series *YOU*, featuring the complex and chilling character Joe Goldberg. While watching the show, I became curious — just how many people has Joe killed? How many fake identities has he used? And how many survived his infamous glass cage?

There was no dataset available to answer these questions. But then I came across an article on Netflix Tudum that summarized many of these stats:

That became the starting point.

## The Idea  
Instead of waiting for a dataset, I decided to create my own. Using the numbers from the article, I structured the data manually, cleaned it up, and brought it into Power BI. The goal was to design a single-page dashboard that feels true to the dark, psychological tone of the series — while making the numbers easy to explore.

## What This Project Covers  
- **Data Collection**: Manually extracted stats from a narrative article  
- **Data Cleaning**: Structured the data in Excel and ensured accuracy  
- **Power BI Design**: Created a dark-themed, visually striking dashboard  
- **Storytelling**: Focused on clarity and impact while staying true to the show’s atmosphere  

## Key Visual Features  
- Total confirmed kills by Joe  
- Number of love interests  
- Number of aliases  
- How many survived the cage  


## Why This Project Matters  
It’s easy to analyze clean datasets someone else has prepared. But real-world data work often starts with chaos — or in this case, no data at all. This project pushed me to be resourceful, creative, and thoughtful about how to present insights when no template exists.

## What’s Next  
I’m considering adding a timeline of events or building a character network based on Joe’s interactions across seasons. If you have ideas or want to collaborate, I’d love to hear from you.

## Tools Used  
- Power BI  
- Excel
